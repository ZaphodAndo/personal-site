Welcome to my blog that I have been creating over the past couple of weeks.

This is the place where I plan on posting all of my rants and raves about things as well as useful guides and posts
about what I have learnt over time.

So if you are remotely interested in that sort of content then great this is the site for you otherwise what are you
doing here? Go watch [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or something. ðŸ¦€
